  <h2> Parametric Line Envelopes </h2>
  <p> This applet allows you to draw envelopes of families of lines, where the lines are defined by their endpoints which each have a parametric formula for x and y. </p>
  <p> It uses JavaScript's evaluations of functions, so type "a**b" to take a power. The test function box can be used to show that a guess for the envelope is correct, and you can set your own parameters for easy generalization. </p>
  <p> In order to work with parameters, you must enter them in the form "A=1,B=2", etc. - your input should consist of sets of variable declarations separated by commas, with each declaration coming in the form of a variable name, an equals sign, and a value unseparated by spaces. Please note that you cannot reference other variables in your variable declarations.</p>
  <p> Type the points or ranges exactly as shown (e.g. "0,t")</p>
  <p> This applet also supports the sqrt(), ln(), sin(), and cos() functions in addition to the variables e and pi, so type those in as written in order to use those built-in features. <\p>
  <p> Built by Josh and Zach Dunbrack </p>
